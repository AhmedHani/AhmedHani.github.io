My name is Ahmed. I am 25 years old.

I am interested in research field since I was in my second year at my faculty.

I love and keen on Machine Learning, Swarm Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. So, this blog will be about the fields that I work on such as computer science, philosophy and maybe writing an opinion about specific events.

I made this blog because I found that it is a good thing when expressing my thoughts and spread my knowledge to others who find what I write is useful for them.

Currently, I am M.Sc student at Faculty of Computer and Information Science Cairo_University [2016 â€“ 2019(expected)].

I am about to begin my thesis, which will be on Natural Language Processing topic. Actually, I havenâ€™t determined yet what the topic will be, there are many topics that I am interested in. You can suggest me a topic to make a research on it. ðŸ™‚
